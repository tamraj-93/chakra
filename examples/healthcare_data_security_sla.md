# Healthcare Data Security SLA

## Service Level Agreement for Healthcare Data Management Systems

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) governs the data security and performance standards for healthcare data management systems.

## 1. Availability and Uptime

1.1. **System Uptime**: The system shall maintain 99.95% uptime, measured monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.

1.2. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Maintenance will be performed during low-usage periods (typically 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM local time) and limited to 4 hours per month.

1.3. **Emergency Maintenance**: Emergency maintenance requires 2-hour advance notification to designated contacts.

## 2. Data Security Requirements

2.1. **Encryption Standards**: 
- All patient data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- All data transmissions must use TLS 1.2 or higher
- Encryption keys must be rotated every 90 days

2.2. **Access Controls**:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all administrative access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation mandatory
- Authentication timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Failed login attempts limited to 5 before account lockout

2.3. **Audit Logging**:
- All system access must be logged with timestamp, user ID, and action taken
- Logs must be retained for a minimum of 7 years
- Log files must be tamper-proof and stored separately from application data

## 3. Performance Metrics

3.1. **Response Time**:
- Web interface response: 2 seconds or less for 95% of requests
- Database queries: 1 second or less for 95% of queries
- Report generation: 5 seconds or less for standard reports

3.2. **Capacity**:
- System must support concurrent access by at least 500 healthcare providers
- Database must handle at least 10,000 patient record retrievals per hour
- Maximum file upload size: 100MB per file

3.3. **Scalability**:
- System must accommodate 20% annual growth in data volume
- Additional capacity must be provisioned when utilization exceeds 75%

## 4. HIPAA Compliance Requirements

4.1. **Privacy Controls**:
- PHI access limited to authorized personnel with a business need
- Automated PHI access reviews conducted quarterly
- Data access logs provided upon request within 24 hours

4.2. **Breach Notification**:
- Security incidents involving PHI reported within 1 hour of discovery
- Full breach assessment provided within 24 hours
- Patient notification coordination within timeframes specified by HIPAA

4.3. **Compliance Auditing**:
- Annual third-party HIPAA compliance audit
- Quarterly internal compliance assessments
- Documentation made available to customers upon request

## 5. Disaster Recovery

5.1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 2 hours for critical systems
5.2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes maximum data loss
5.3. **Backup Schedule**: Hourly incremental backups, daily full backups
5.4. **Backup Testing**: Monthly recovery testing from backup media

## 6. Support and Incident Response

6.1. **Support Availability**: 24/7/365 for Severity 1 issues

6.2. **Incident Response Times**:
- Severity 1 (Critical): 15-minute response, 2-hour resolution
- Severity 2 (High): 30-minute response, 4-hour resolution
- Severity 3 (Medium): 2-hour response, 8-hour resolution
- Severity 4 (Low): 8-hour response, 24-hour resolution

6.3. **Incident Definition**:
- Severity 1: Complete system unavailability or security breach
- Severity 2: Major functionality impaired or potential security threat
- Severity 3: Minor functionality issues affecting multiple users
- Severity 4: Cosmetic issues or documentation problems

## 7. Penalties and Remedies

7.1. **Service Credits**:
- Uptime below 99.95%: 10% monthly fee credit
- Uptime below 99.9%: 25% monthly fee credit
- Uptime below 99.5%: 50% monthly fee credit

7.2. **Security Breach Penalties**:
- Additional contractual penalties apply as specified in the Master Service Agreement
